# conversational_ai_demo
Conversational AI for patient intake and appt scheduling.

The AI agent will do the following:
- Collect patient's name and date of birth
- Collect insurance information (Payer name and ID)
- Ask if they have a referral, if so, who
- Collect chief medical complaint/reason they are seeking help
- Collect other demographics (address, marital status, ethnicity, etc)
- Collect contact information (email, phone number, and prefered method of contact)
- Offer up best available providers and times

The call should not be considered resolved until these pieces of information are all received. After the call ends, send a text to the caller that informs them of their selected appointment date and time, and which doctor they will be seeing.
